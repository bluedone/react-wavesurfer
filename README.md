# react-wavesurfer

__This project is under active development, the functionality is still pretty rugged.__

Implemented so far:

* WaveSurfer instantiation options can be set by component props
* WaveSurfer events trigger callbacks passed in as props (prefixed with on and capitalised, e.g. the event *ready* triggers the *onReady* prop callback)
* WaveSurver position, playing status and audioFile can be dynamically set by props

__Note:__ This component is subject to breaking changes in the near future. The wavesurfer.js library (including its plugins) will change its module format in the near future. This will allow this component to have better plugins support out of the box.


## Usage

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Wavesurfer from 'react-wavesurfer';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      playing: false,
      pos: 0
    };
    this.handleTogglePlay = this.handleTogglePlay.bind(this);
    this.handlePosChange = this.handlePosChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleTogglePlay() {
    this.setState({
      playing: !this.state.playing
    });
  }
  handlePosChange(e) {
    this.setState({
      pos: e.originalArgs[0]
    });
  }
  render() {
    let props = this.state;
    return (
      <div>
        <Wavesurfer
          audioFile={'path/to/audio/file.mp3'}
          pos={this.state.pos}
          onPosChange={this.handlePosChange}
          playing={this.state.playing}
        />
      </div>
      );
  }
}
```

## Props

Prop name | type | description
--- | --- | ---
`playing` | bool | controls wether the player is playing
`volume` | number | [0â€“1]
`pos` | number | position of playback in seconds
`audioFile` | string/blob | the audio to render, can be set after the component was mounted
`options` | object | the instantiation options for wavesurfer. See [documentation of wavesurfer.js](https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js#wavesurfer-options). The defaults values are the default values of wavesurfer.js

### Callback props

#### Passing the playback position to a callback

If you want to use a callback specifically to receive the playback position you can use the `onPosChange` prop callback. It is basically called on `audioprocess` and `seek` events and receives the same type of argument object as the `onAudioprocess` callback: `{ wavesurfer: wavesurferInstance, originalArgs: [playBackPositionInSecs] }`

This function is a hack. Otherwise to be able to work with the playback position would require you to pass both `onSeek` and `onAudioprocess` to the component. However the `onSeek` function would receive the position in a different format (as a float) than the `onAudioprocess` function (in seconds). So this is just way to keep things simple until this issue has been properly resolved. (https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js/issues/618)

See the `example/index.jsx` for a simple example how to use this.

#### Wavesurfer event callbacks

You can hook into wavesurfer events via functions you define as props. They can be used to wire up wavesurfer plugins until proper support for them is added. They receive an object of parameters:

```javascript
{
  wavesurfer, // the wavesurfer instance
  originalArgs // an array of the arguments the original event callback received
}
```

The full list of available callback props, see [documentation of wavesurfer.js](https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js#wavesurfer-events) for further information:

`onAudioprocess`
`onError`
`onFinish`
`onLoading`
`onMouseup`
`onPause`
`onPlay`
`onReady`
`onScroll`
`onSeek`
`onZoom`
