# react-wavesurfer

_This project is under active development, the functionality is still pretty rugged. Any contribution is greatly appreciated_

Implemented so far:

* WaveSurfer instantiation options can be set by component props
* WaveSurfer events trigger callbacks passed in as props (prefixed with on and capitalised, e.g. the event *ready* triggers the *onReady* prop callback)
* WaveSurver position, playing status and audioFile can be dynamically set by props

Todos:

* Integrate Timeline, Regions, Minimap
* Tests!
